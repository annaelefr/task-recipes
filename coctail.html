        <p>I have served this mojito pitcher recipe to people who have sworn that they dislike mojitos and they loved it! I believe it's the fresh ingredients and the use of sugar, instead of simple syrup, muddled together that makes this cocktail refreshing and delicious. It takes a little bit of work but the results are well worth it. Serve over ice.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>

            <li>3 medium limes, quartered</li>
            <li>1 liter club soda</li>
            <li>Ice</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Muddle sugar and mint leaves together </li>
            <li>Add limes and muddle until limes are juiced.</li>
            <li>Add club soda and stir until sugar is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
